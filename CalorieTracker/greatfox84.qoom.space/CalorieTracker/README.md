CaloCount
==================
## What this project does
This project calculates the amount of calories and water one needs to intake based on his/her height, weight, age, and amount of exercise. It also includes many nutrional and hydration tips as well as an interactive map. 
## Why this project is useful
Many people are unsure of many dietary actions they should perform and this helps to inform them. Especially during the Coronavirus pandemic where many people are stuck inside, people are feeling more unhealthy and do not know what to do. This assists them with advice.
## How we built this 
We used Qoom as the serving hosting platform. We created a survey and then calculated the results. There are many more additional features like the maps and extra hyperlinks for the importance of balance diets and water that we had to add. We used HTML, CSS, and a lot of Javascript.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
Prior to this hackathon, we barely knew any front-end programming languages at all (HTML, CSS, Javascript). We had to learn it all on the fly so considering that, the website turned out nice. Even with our limited knowledge in the field, we problem solved and made a cool application.
## What is next for this project
This project could better be turned into an app from here as it would be more applicable to more people. Once Qoom allows it, adding in server-side features through back-end APIs would also be a huge improvement. There is also more work that could be put in to style it better.
